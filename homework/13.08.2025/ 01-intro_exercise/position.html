      Hurra-yi Khuttali (fl. c. 1006 – c. 1040) was a princess from the
      Ghaznavid dynasty and the daughter of Sabuktigin, ruler of Ghazna (now in
      Afghanistan); her date and place of birth are unknown. Her intelligence
      and tactfulness gave her an influential role in governmental matters. She
      was married to two Maʽmunid rulers of the Khwarazm region, Abu al-Hasan
      Ali and, after his death, his brother Maʽmun II. It is not known if she
      had children with either of her husbands. Her marriages were a direct
      cause of the annexation of Khwarazm by her brother, Mahmud of Ghazni. In
      1030, upon Mahmud's death, she wrote a letter to her favourite nephew,
      Masʽud, urging him to claim the throne from his brother, Muhammad. After
      receiving her missive, Masʽud quickly marched to Ghazna and usurped the
      throne. Hurra's letter is considered the most prominent political act of a
      woman during the Ghaznavid era. She is last mentioned in 1040, leaving
      Ghazna for India; her ultimate fate is unknown. (Full article...)
